# Home Farmer Robot

The Home Farmer Robot is a semi-automatic plant care robot designed to monitor and maintain optimal growing conditions for small-scale indoor farming. Built for the World Robot Olympiad competition, this project uses a bunch of sensors and coding logic to automate irrigation and environmental monitoring.

## Features

- Soil moisture detection
- Automatic water pumping when soil is dry
- Temperature and humidity monitoring
- LCD/LED status indicators
- Manual Function calling (if required at all)
- Completely Customizeable

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Embedded C  
- **IDE:** Arduino IDE  
- **Hardware:** Arduino, Soil Moisture Sensor, Water Pump, DHT11, DS1307 (RTC)

> ⚠️ The code might need to be updated or calibrated based on your sensor models and pump specifications.
